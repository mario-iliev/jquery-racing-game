jQuery Racing Game - Exercise project

###DEMO: http://demos.marioiliev.com/battle-car/

This project was made with inspiration by javascript and it's endless possibilities.

The game includes:

1. Catching coins, bullets and shields.

2. Avoiding enemy cars and road objects.

3. Boss to fight against.

4. Option to shoot and slow the enemies speed.

5. Visual effects such as switching day and night, flying objects and more.

This whole thing became heavy for some devices, but it's running OK for my laptop Chrome/Windows.
Since I was just fooling around, the game is not perfect, finished or free of bugs.
But after my effort nevertheless I decided to provide the code and the game itself.
